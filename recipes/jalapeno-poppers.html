    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>12 fresh jalapeño peppers</li>
      <li>
        8 ounces (about 1 cup) of cream cheese, softened (you can also use
        cheddar cheese or a combination of both)
      </li>
      <li>
        1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (optional, if not using cheddar cheese in
        the cream cheese mixture)
      </li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup breadcrumbs (you can use plain or seasoned breadcrumbs)</li>
      <li>Cooking oil for frying (vegetable oil or canola oil works well)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash the jalapeño peppers and cut off the tops. Slice them in half
        lengthwise and remove the seeds and membranes to reduce the heat. Wear
        gloves or wash your hands thoroughly after handling jalapeños to avoid
        irritation.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, garlic powder, onion
        powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix until well combined. Optionally, you
        can add shredded cheddar cheese for extra flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a spoon or a piping bag, fill each jalapeño half with the cream
        cheese mixture, ensuring they are well-stuffed but not overflowing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll each stuffed jalapeño in flour, then dip it in the beaten eggs, and
        finally coat it in breadcrumbs, making sure they are evenly coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat about 2 inches of cooking oil in a deep pan or skillet to 350°F
        (175°C). Carefully place the coated jalapeño poppers into the hot oil
        and fry until they are golden brown and crispy, usually for about 2-3
        minutes per side. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and
        place them on paper towels to drain any excess oil. Serve your homemade
        Jalapeño Poppers while they're still hot and crispy. Enjoy them as a
        delicious appetizer or snack, and consider serving them with a dipping
        sauce of your choice, such as ranch dressing or a sour cream-based sauce
        with lime juice and cilantro for added flavor.
