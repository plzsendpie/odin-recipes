    <h4>For the Pastry Cream Filling:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Chocolate Ganache Glaze:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>For the Yellow Cake Layers:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round
        cake pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and
        granulated sugar until light and fluffy, which should take about 2-3
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract.</li>
      <li>
        Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with
        the milk. Start and end with the dry ingredients, mixing until just
        combined after each addition.
      </li>
      <li>Divide the cake batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick
        inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the cakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then remove them
        from the pans and place them on a wire rack to cool completely.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For the Pastry Cream Filling:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat until it begins to
        steam but is not boiling. Remove it from the heat and set it aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, and egg
        yolks until the mixture is pale and slightly thickened.
      </li>
      <li>Gradually whisk the warm milk into the egg mixture.</li>
      <li>
        Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking
        constantly until it thickens and comes to a boil. This should take about
        5-7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the pastry cream from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the pastry cream to a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap,
        pressing the wrap directly against the surface of the cream to prevent a
        skin from forming.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refrigerate the pastry cream until it's chilled and set, which usually
        takes about 2 hours.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For the Chocolate Ganache Glaze:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a microwave-safe bowl or on the stovetop, heat the heavy cream until
        it's hot but not boiling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chopped chocolate and butter to the hot cream and let it sit for
        a minute to soften.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir the mixture until the chocolate and butter are completely melted
        and the ganache is smooth. Allow it to cool slightly.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assembly:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Place one of the cooled cake layers on a serving plate.</li>
      <li>
        Spread the chilled pastry cream evenly over the top of this layer.
      </li>
      <li>Place the second cake layer on top of the pastry cream.</li>
      <li>
        Pour the chocolate ganache over the top of the cake, allowing it to drip
        down the sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refrigerate the Boston Cream Pie for at least 1-2 hours to allow the
        ganache to set.
      </li>
      <li>Slice, serve, and enjoy your homemade Boston Cream Pie!</li>
    </ol>
