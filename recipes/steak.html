    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 boneless ribeye or New York strip steaks (about 1 inch thick)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 sprigs of fresh rosemary (or your preferred herbs)</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>
        Optional: Steak seasoning or rub of your choice (e.g., Montreal steak
        seasoning)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Bring the Steak to Room Temperature:</strong> <br> <p>Remove the steaks from the
        refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature for about 30-45
        minutes. This helps ensure even cooking.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Preheat the Grill or Pan:</strong> <br> If using a grill, preheat it to high heat
        (about 450-500°F/232-260°C). If using a stovetop, heat a heavy skillet
        (cast iron works well) over high heat until it's very hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Season the Steaks:</strong> <br> Drizzle the olive oil over both sides of the steaks
        and rub it in. Then, sprinkle minced garlic evenly over the steaks.
        Season both sides generously with salt, black pepper, and any steak
        seasoning or rub you prefer. Press the seasonings into the meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Grill or Pan-Sear the Steaks:</strong> <br> Place the steaks on the hot grill or in
        the hot skillet. If you're using a grill, close the lid. For medium-rare
        steaks, cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side (adjust the time based
        on your desired level of doneness). For pan-searing, use a pair of tongs
        to flip the steaks when they develop a nice sear, usually after 4-5
        minutes. Cook for an additional 4-5 minutes on the other side.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rest the Steaks:</strong> <br> Remove the steaks from the grill or skillet and place
        them on a cutting board or a warm plate. Tent them loosely with aluminum
        foil and let them rest for about 5-10 minutes. This resting period
        allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, ensuring a juicy
        steak.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Slice and Serve:</strong> <br> After resting, slice the steaks against the grain for
        maximum tenderness. Serve immediately, garnished with fresh rosemary
        sprigs or your choice of herbs.
      </li>
    </ol>
